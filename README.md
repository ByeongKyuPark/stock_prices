# The top tech companies' stocks Analysis

I analyzed the top tech companies' stocks, like Apple, Google, and Microsoft, to figure out the best and safest times to buy and sell. Based on my study, the smart time to buy was when the stocks were undervalued – when their prices dropped temporarily despite a strong overall upward trend. For selling, I looked for when they were overvalued – when prices fell sharply in the short term and the long-term growth started to flatten. This matched the real historical data, showing a straightforward way to approach stock investment.
